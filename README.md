# Film-Directory-Name-Cleaner
A little script I whipped up to help me with renaming folders I donwload for my film collection

On windows I used the Advanced Renamer tool, but on MacOS, I can't find an equivalent tool, so I wrote something to help automate the process.

# What It Does:

* Cleans out common tags such as 'WEB', 'H264', 'AMZN', 'H264-MIXED', 'COMPLETE', '10bit', '6CH', 'WEB-DL', 'Bluray', 'x264','anoXmous', 'WEBRip', 'x265-RARBG', 'AC3-EVO', 'XviD', 'HDRip', '720p', '1080p', 'BluRay', etc.

* Changes periods to spaces

# What I Learned:

* Regex is a headache, but incredibly useful.
